            <p><em class="instructor-name">Sean Hayes</em>
            <br>Northwest Academy of Arms</p>
            <p>Sean was born in 1962 and raised in the Midwest region of the United States. He initially studied classical French fencing under Maitre d'armes Adam Adrian Crown in Ithaca, New York; and also pursued studies of rapier and dagger under Maitre Crown. In 1995 he began his studies of classical Italian fencing at California's San Jose State University Fencing Master's Program, under the direction of Dr. William M. Gaugler.</p>

            <p>Maestro Gaugler, a graduate of the Accademia Nazionale di Scherma in Naples, employs the system of instruction developed by Masaniello Parise, first director of the celebrated 19th century Military Masters School in Rome (Scuola Magistrale di Scherma), with certain elements drawn from the methods of the earlier Military Fencing Masters schools in Parma (directed by Cesar Enrichetti), Milan (directed by Giuseppe Radailli), and from the later Livornese school (as exemplified by Eugenio Pini and Beppe Nadi).</p>

            <p>Maestro Hayes apprenticed under Maestro Gaugler from 1995 to 1999, and was trained to think critically about the details of fencing theory and the application of fencing theory in actual practice, to work with students closely and carefully, and to observe the most minute aspects of their performance in the lesson and when fencing. He earned his Fencing Master's diploma in May of 1999 after passing a rigorous three-year series of written, oral and practical examinations, including the preparation of an academic thesis in the final year.</p>

            <p>Maestro Hayes' examination for Master At Arms was advertised and open to the public, and conducted by an international board of 6 fencing masters representing the United States, France, and Italy. The examination included oral and practical components: intense questioning on the smallest aspects of classical Italian fencing theory; the candidate required to teach group lessons, individual lessons, take individual lessons; and finally to teach any actions or combination of several actions in any weapons desired by the board to a fellow candidate.

            <p>Maestro Hayes teaches a strictly classical curriculum of Italian foil, épée and sabre at Northwest Academy of Arms in Eugene, Oregon, and through the University of Oregon and Lane Community College. He also researches and teaches Italian Rapier of the early and late 17th century and 18th century; the medieval martial arts system of Fiore dei Liberi; and German Sword & Buckler from Royal Armouries Manuscript I.33 (ca 1295 AD, the oldest known fencing manuscript).
            <br>Classes are medieval longsword in the German Liechtenauer tradition and renaissance Italian rapier fencing.</p>

            <p><em class="instructor-name">Jason Smith</em>
            <br>Les Maitres des Armes
            <p>Jason has studied and practised historical swordplay in various styles since 2001, beginning with theatrical swordplay and moving into a mix of various traditions from a variety of manuscripts available at the time. His first exposure to HEMA (historical European Martial Arts) was in the form of the Codex Wallerstein, followed closely by Talhoffer’s fechtbuch that was available at the time. A study of the German systems from Johannes Liechtenauer followed, using available source material as well as published works. At this time, Jason and Bernard Emmerich formed a study group that was to become Les Maîtres D’armes school of armizare.</p>

            <p>Jason’s focus shifted exclusively to the works of Fiore dei Liberi to better progress in the Art by concentrating on one Master and his body of work, and he continues to share his understanding of the Art with his students and the community at large.</p>

            <p>Jason works as the curriculum director for the school, as well as the being its principal instructor. His current interests are grappling, dagger, longsword and arming sword, with a passing interest in the spear – all of the dei Liberi tradition. Furthermore, Jason is currently teaching, researching and translating the 15th century Burgundian manuscript Jeu de la Hache in an effort to return to the community that which it gave him.</p>

            <p><em class="instructor-name">Bob Charette</em>
            <br>Forteza Historical Swordwork Guild
            <br>Bob was fascinated by knights and related things as a child. In high school, back in the late 60s, he heard about the SCA and encountered it a few years later in college. It was a revelation to him that the received wisdom in the SCA in those days was that there was no source of information on "how they really did it." Nevertheless he got good enough at that game to receive a knighthood (the martial achievement award).</p>

            <p>Sometime in the 80s, he got his first introduction to Fiore via Steve Hick, who had a photocopy of Novati's PD reproduction with rough translations pasted over the text. Interpretation didn't get very far at that time. About the same time he became involved with the start up of a living history group interpreting English forces in the Hundred Years War, a group that became La Belle Compagnie, which allowed him to indulge his interest in material culture and archeological re-creation.</p>

            <p>During the 90s, as more WMA material was appearing and interpretations improving, he started paying more attention to the sources and began incorporating Fiore and I.33 material into La Belle's presentations, adding martial practice to the group's shows. He has been focusing pretty much exclusively on Fiore for the last 8 years, and recently formed Forteza Historical Swordwork Guild to attempt to regularize my studies.</p>

            <p>An author and illustrator, Bob has co-authored 1381: The Peel Affinity (with La Belle Compagnie), a photographically illustrated look at a year in the life of a knight’s household in rural England, and Armizare: The Chivalric Martial Art System of il Fior di Battaglia.</p>

AD with a focus on the Italian and German medieval fighting manuscripts of the 14th and 15th centuries.
