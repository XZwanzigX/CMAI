            <p>It doesn't matter whether you have taken dozens of classes and workshops or whether you have never done or experienced anything like this before The Chivalric Martial Arts International will be a rewarding and memorable experience. This workshop is designed to expose you to a wide-variety of research by some of the finest <a href="instructors.php" class="textLink">instructors</a> in in the Chivalric Arts in the world.</p>

            <p>Classes will be 90 min long with a 15 min break between them.</p>

            <p><span class="section-heading">Equestrian Training</span>
            <br>This is the part that you will find no where else in the world. For this event we have instruction in riding at any level, games and skills, mounted combat, and finally jousting.</p>

            <p><span class="class-heading">Basic Riding</span><br>
                This track of classes covers several days and includes: safe handling on the ground, correct mounting, goals to develop a balanced seat capable of directing the horse and serve as a foundation for the other aids, will include off horse exercises to encourage rider fitness; an understanding of rein, leg and weight aids to control the horse laterally and longitudinally if not the ability to accomplish at all 3 gaits. This crash course hopes to show the way ahead as well as cover a lot of information in a short time. Participants are encouraged to attend all the classes in the track as each session builds on the skills of the previous class.  Participants in this series of classes will have the opportunity to try out their new found skills on a Skill at Arms course on Thursday.</p>

            <p><span class="class-heading">Mounted Combat</span><br>
            These classes begin to combine horsemanship with the understanding of combat on the horse. Just as footwork is the basis of all martial arts, horsemanship is the basis of all martial arts on horseback. These classes will take the moderate horseman, and teach the rider to used his horsemanship to defeat an opponent on horseback. Throws, grapples, displacements, and other techniques will be taught. There will be an "equisims" available for those who don't ride, but wish to cover the material. Specific training on the behourd will be discussed as well.</p>

            <p><span class="section-heading">Classroom Instruction</span><br>
            Classroom instruction is a great way to slow down, sit back and really delve into many  aspects of knighthood and chivalry during the middle ages and currently as well as some classes geared toward  expanding your understanding of Historical European Martial Arts.</p>

            <p><span>Western Combative theory-Ken Mondschein</span><br/>
            There is remarkable continuity in the way in which combative actions have
            been described since the late fourteenth century. In order to better
            understand the tactics and strategies described in medieval fencing
            manuals, we must first learn their intellectual underpinnings. This class
            will explain both the history and current use of the classification of
            fencing actions in the Western tradition.</p>

            <p><span>Historical European Martial Arts: A Historical Overview-Ken Mondschein</span><br/>
            How has fencing evolved from the enigmatic sword and buckler play in I.33
            to the byzantine rules of the modern sort of fencing? How have Western
            Martial Arts changed from a life-and-death martial art to a sport? This
            class will explore the history of Western martial arts, our sources, and
            how recent history has transformed both the arts and our understanding of
            them.</p>

            <p><span>War, Tournament, Knighthood, and Society- Ken Mondschein</span><br/>
            What was a knight? What was his role in society? How did the tournament
            fit into this? We will explore the self-conception of the medieval knight,
            and the uses of the tournament from everything from training for battle to
            political theatre.</p>

            <p><span>Building from Interpretation to Curriculum - Sean Hayes</span><br/>
            This presentation will cover the basics of developing a curriculum from primary sources, using the Fior di Battaglia and Royal Armouries MS I.33 as examples.  Lesson plans and curricula are distinct from the technical (or "how-to") sources.  A program of instruction includes fundamental physical and movement training that supports the technique shown in the sources, and it also includes tactical training derived from the techniques and commentaries of the original masters.  The class will consist of lecture, question-and-answer, and demonstration.</p>

            <p><span>Concepts of Modern Chivalry- Randall Parr</span><br/>
            This presentation will discuss why chivalry is experiencing a revival today, and how traditional ideals of knightly behavior are relevantly translated and applied to modern culture.</p>

            <p><span>An Introduction to the International Jousting League  - Fred Piraux</span><br/>
            This class will cover the details on how to become involved with the IJL; the mission statement, structure and rules; the state of competitive jousting in the world today; how to become an IJL affiliate (as an individual or event); competitions included in the IJL.</p>

            <p><span>How to Get Started in Competitive Jousting  - Fred Piraux</span><br/>
            This class covers the basic of what is needed to start jousting; armour requirements, working with an armourer, safety considerations.</p>

            <p><span>List Field Operation  - Fred Piraux</span><br/>
            This class will cover the details of what is needed to safely construct and run a jousting list field; rules, match rotation and timing, field personnel, how to properly conduct the passes, field safety and procedures.</p>

            <p><span class="CMAI-Headline-Text">Foot Combat</span><br/>
            These training sessions will not <em>require</em> full harness to participate, but the Armored Combat series will require more harness to fully explore these concepts. Please consider a mail shirt, gauntlets, and a helmet as a minimum to provided sufficient protection to explore many of the armored classes. Participation in the Armored Combat series is mandatory to all who intend in participating in the armored Deeds at Arms.</p>

            <p class="day-heading">Day 1</p>

            <p><span>10:45a</span>              	<span class="class-name">"God, the Art, myself, and my sword": Fiore de Liberi's Unarmoured Combat</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Sean Hayes<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> steel longsword, gambeson, head, face and eye protection that simulates an unarmoured head (such as a fencing mask), leather gloves.<br>
            <em>"Out of envy, some Masters challenged me to combat with sharp swords in a gambeson and without any other defensive weapon besides a pair of chamois gloves. Five times I was compelled by honor to fight in strange places, far away from relatives or friends and without anything to rely upon besides God, the Art, myself, Fiore, and my sword. By the grace of God, I came through each time with my honor intact and without any physical injuries."- Fiore dei Liberi, Fior di Battaglia, 1410</em>
            <br><br>
            Based on these experiences, Fiore advises his students that fighting in armour in the lists is preferable to fighting without armour, since without armour "a single failed parry can be fatal , while in the lists a combatant wearing good armor can receive multiple hits and still go on to win the fight."  This class will examine the fundamentals of fighting without armour, focusing on tactical approaches shown by Fiore to strike without being struck, how to fight at wide range, and how to close for grappling.  Required Equipment: steel longsword, gambeson, head, face and eye protection that simulates an unarmoured head (such as a fencing mask), leather gloves.

            <p><span>1:30p</span>			<span class="class-name">Armored Combat 1</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Foot Combat Instructors<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> Harness<br>
            The first day will focus on the wearing of harness, moving in harness, body awareness and sensitivity in harness, and the weakness of armor.</p>

            <p><span>3:15p</span>             	<span class="class-name">Fundamentals of the system - footwork, guards, blows and parries. aka "Pollaxe for Dummies"</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Jason Smith<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> Pollaxe simulator<br>
            This class will focus on the fundamentals of the Burgundian pollaxe manuscript "Le Jeu de la Hache."  Core mechanics and concepts will be visited, such as footwork, the attacks, defences and precepts of the system. All levels of student are welcome,</p>

            <p class="day-heading">Day 2</p>

            <p><span>9:00a</span> 		<span class="class-name">Great Stick</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Ken Mondschein<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> a large stick<br>
            The greatstick is the living descendant of the longsword, and provides an excellent and historically accurate way to begin internalizing both physical mechanics and basic fencing principles. This class will concentrate on basic manipulation and tactical ideas, with a focus on
            giving students a technical basis for the study of medieval martial arts.</p>

            <p><span>10:45a</span>			<span class="class-name">Armored Combat 2</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Foot Combat Instructors<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> Harness, dagger simulator<br>
            The focus will be on wrestling in armor, falling in armor, the use of the dagger in harness</p>

            <p><span>1:30p</span>            	<span class="class-name">Hooks, disarms and binds: Intricacies of the Knightly Swiss army knife</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Jason Smith<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> Pollaxe simulator<br>
            The pollaxe is a versatile weapon, and favoured by the knightly class in single combat for that versatility. This class will explore that versatility through the Burgundian manuscript "Le Jeu de la Hache" and its plays as they occur from the bind. Included the various hooks, disarms, grapples and takedowns of the system, with an exploration of how we can apply the principles outside of canon. Some previous pollaxe experience is preferred, but not required.</p>

            <p><span>3:15p</span>			<span class="class-name">Armored Combat 3</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Foot Combat Instructors<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> Harness, dagger, sword, poleaxe,  spear simulators<br>
            Session three will introduce the knightly weapons i.e. Sword, Spear and Poleaxe.  drills and combat</p>

            <p class="day-heading">Day 3</p>

            <p><span>9:00a</span> 		           	<span class="class-name">The Dagger of Fiore</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Scott Wilson<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> dagger simulator<br>
            The dagger is a person's "go to" weapon of self defense. Fiore's dagger section is the longest and most involved part of the manual. Students will train dagger techniques and learn which ones are "good in armor" and why.</p>

            <p><span>10:45a</span>            	<span class="class-name">Sword in Armour: Fighting at the Full Sword and the Half Sword</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Sean Hayes<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> steel longsword with rubber or leather blunt attached, harness<br>
            Armoured combat often employs the sword as a short spear, by grasping the blade with one hand, commonly referred to as "half-swording."  While most of the armoured guards show this style of grip, Fiore also uses the sword in a "standard" grip, at the full sword.  This class will practice the use of both forms in matched and unmatched combinations, and examine the tactical uses of switching between these grips.</p>

            <p><span>1:30p</span>             	<span class="class-name">The sinister pollaxe: Playing from the left in Le Jeu</span><br>

            <span>Required Equipment:</span> pollaxe<br>
            In this class, we will visit the left-handed plays of the manuscript and how it deals with playing against someone fighting from the left. Students will visit the plays from both perspectives to experience how the principles illustrated in the manuscript can be applied regardless of handedness, and how the dynamics of off-hand play affect the fight. Having attended the introductory Jeu class "Pollaxe for Dummies" is preferred, or some previous experience with the pollaxe.</p>

            <p><span>3:15p</span>			<span class="class-name">Armored Combat 4</span><br>
            <span>Instructor:</span> Foot Combat Instructors<br>
            <span>Required Equipment:</span> Harness, dagger, sword, poleaxe,  spear simulators<br>
            Students will practice the concepts with instructors and other students in a coached environment to improve the students understanding and ability to apply these concepts while in combat in harness.</p>
