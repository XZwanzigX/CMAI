            <p>It doesn't matter whether you have taken dozens of classes and workshops or whether you have never done or experienced anything like this before The Chivalric Martial Arts International will be a rewarding and memorable experience. This workshop is designed to expose you to a wide-variety of research by some of the finest <a href="instructors.php" class="textLink">instructors</a> in in the Chivalric Arts in the world.</p>

            <p>Classes will be 90 min long with a 15 min break between them.</p>

            <p class="CMAI-Headline-Text">Types of Classes</p>

            <p class="section-heading">Progressive Training</p>


            <p>The focus of this training will be practical application.  Students will be able to fall in, find a partner and follow along with the class. All instructors who are not participating in other classes will combine efforts to teach concepts irrespective of their personal research interests.</p>

            <p>The first day will focus on the wearing of harness, moving, falling, and infighting (wrestling and dagger) Day two will begin to expand into the knightly weapons i.e. Sword and Spear and by the third day the poleaxe will be added.  The progressive training will allow you to move in and out of this track to be able to concentrate on horsemanship as well.</p>

            <p>Classes will be of two types: <span class="special-emphasis">Focused training</span> where the lead instructor will present concepts and the students will partner practice these concepts. <span class="special-emphasis">Coached In harness</span>  where students will practice the concepts with instructors and other students in a coached environment to improve the students understanding and ability to apply these concepts while in combat in harness.</p>

            <p>Focus training will not require full harness to participate, though full harness is always preferred. Coached training will require more harness to fully explore these concepts, but can be done provided sufficient protective equipment is worn. Participation in  coached training is mandatory to all who intend in participating in the tournament.</p>

            <p class="section-heading">Specialized Training</p>

            <p>These are classes where our instructors can present material specific to their research, especially research on a particular historic manual. See specific class descriptions below:</p>
            <p class="section-heading">Equestrian Training
            <br>This is the part that you will find no where else in the world. For this event we have instruction in riding at any level, games and skills, mounted combats, and finally jousting.</p>

            <p><span class="class-heading">Basic Riding</span><br>
                This track of classes covers several days and includes: safe handling on the ground, correct mounting, goals to develop a balanced seat capable of directing the horse and serve as a foundation for the other aids, will include off horse exercises to encourage rider fitness; an understanding of rein, leg and weight aids to control the horse laterally and longitudinally if not the ability to accomplish at all 3 gaits. This crash course hopes to show the way ahead as well as cover a lot of information in a short time. Participants are encouraged to attend all the classes in the track as each session builds on the skills of the previous class.  Participants in this series of classes will have the opportunity to try out their new found skills on a Skill at Arms course on Thursday.</p>

            <p><span class="class-heading">Mounted Combat</span><br>
            These classes begin to combine horsemanship with the understanding of combat on the horse. Just as footwork is the basis of all martial arts, horsemanship is the basis of all martial arts on horseback. These classes will take the moderate horseman, and teach the rider to used his horsemanship to defeat an opponent on horseback. Throws, grapples, displacements, and other techniques will be taught. There will be an “equisims” available for those who don’t ride, but wish to cover the material. Specific training on the behourd will be discussed as well.</p>

            <span>Required Equipment:</span> pollaxe<br>
            In this class, we will visit the left-handed plays of the manuscript and how it deals with playing against someone fighting from the left. Students will visit the plays from both perspectives to experience how the principles illustrated in the manuscript can be applied regardless of handedness, and how the dynamics of off-hand play affect the fight. Having attended the introductory Jeu class "Pollaxe for Dummies" is preferred, or some previous experience with the pollaxe.</p>
