            <p>It doesn't matter whether you have taken dozens of classes and workshops or whether you have never done or experienced anything like this before The Chivalric Martial Arts International will be a rewarding and memorable experience. This workshop is designed to expose you to a wide-variety of research by some of the finest <a href="instructors.php" class="textLink">instructors</a> in in the Chivalric Arts in the world.</p>

            <p>Classes will be 90 min long with a 15 min break between them.</p>

            <p class="CMAI-Headline-Text">Types of Classes</p>

            <p class="section-heading">Progressive Training</p>


            <p>The focus of this training will be practical application.  Students will be able to fall in, find a partner and follow along with the class. All instructors who are not participating in other classes will combine efforts to teach concepts irrespective of their personal research interests.</p>

            <p>The first day will focus on the wearing of harness, moving, falling, and infighting (wrestling and dagger) Day two will begin to expand into the knightly weapons i.e. Sword and Spear and by the third day the poleaxe will be added.  The progressive training will allow you to move in and out of this track to be able to concentrate on horsemanship as well.</p>

            <p>Classes will be of two types: <span class="special-emphasis">Focused training</span> where the lead instructor will present concepts and the students will partner practice these concepts. <span class="special-emphasis">Coached In harness</span>  where students will practice the concepts with instructors and other students in a coached environment to improve the students understanding and ability to apply these concepts while in combat in harness.</p>

            <p>Focus training will not require full harness to participate, though full harness is always preferred. Coached training will require more harness to fully explore these concepts, but can be done provided sufficient protective equipment is worn. Participation in  coached training is mandatory to all who intend in participating in the tournament.</p>

            <p class="section-heading">Specialized Training</p>

            <p>These are classes where our instructors can present material specific to their research, especially research on a particular historic manual. See specific class descriptions below:</p>
            <p class="section-heading">Equestrian Training
            <br>This is the part that you will find no where else in the world. For this event we have instruction in riding at any level, games and skills, mounted combats, and finally jousting.</p>

            <p><span class="class-heading">Basic Riding</span><br>
                This track of classes covers several days and includes: safe handling on the ground, correct mounting, goals to develop a balanced seat capable of directing the horse and serve as a foundation for the other aids, will include off horse exercises to encourage rider fitness; an understanding of rein, leg and weight aids to control the horse laterally and longitudinally if not the ability to accomplish at all 3 gaits. This crash course hopes to show the way ahead as well as cover a lot of information in a short time. Participants are encouraged to attend all the classes in the track as each session builds on the skills of the previous class.  Participants in this series of classes will have the opportunity to try out their new found skills on a Skill at Arms course on Thursday.</p>

            <p><span class="class-heading">Mounted Combat</span><br>
            These classes begin to combine horsemanship with the understanding of combat on the horse. Just as footwork is the basis of all martial arts, horsemanship is the basis of all martial arts on horseback. These classes will take the moderate horseman, and teach the rider to used his horsemanship to defeat an opponent on horseback. Throws, grapples, displacements, and other techniques will be taught. There will be an “equisims” available for those who don’t ride, but wish to cover the material. Specific training on the behourd will be discussed as well.</p>

            <p><span class="class-heading">Classroom Instruction</span><br>
            Classroom instruction is a great way to slow down, sit back and really delve into many  aspects of knighthood and chivalry during the middle ages and currently as well as some classes geared toward  expanding your understanding of Historical European Martial Arts.</p>

            <p><span>Western Combative theory-Ken Mondeshien</span><br/>
            There is remarkable continuity in the way in which combative actions have
            been described since the late fourteenth century. In order to better
            understand the tactics and strategies described in medieval fencing
            manuals, we must first learn their intellectual underpinnings. This class
            will explain both the history and current use of the classification of
            fencing actions in the Western tradition.</p>

            <p><span>Historical European Martial Arts: A Historical Overview-Ken Mondeshien</span><br/>
            How has fencing evolved from the enigmatic sword and buckler play in I.33
            to the byzantine rules of the modern sort of fencing? How have Western
            Martial Arts changed from a life-and-death martial art to a sport? This
            class will explore the history of Western martial arts, our sources, and
            how recent history has transformed both the arts and our understanding of
            them.</p>

            <p><span>War, Tournament, Knighthood, and Society- Ken Mondeshien</span><br/>
            What was a knight? What was his role in society? How did the tournament
            fit into this? We will explore the self-conception of the medieval knight,
            and the uses of the tournament from everything from training for battle to
            political theatre.</p>

            <p><span>Building from Interpretation to Curriculum - Sean Hayes</span><br/>
            This presentation will cover the basics of developing a curriculum from primary sources, using the Fior di Battaglia and Royal Armouries MS I.33 as examples.  Lesson plans and curricula are distinct from the technical (or "how-to") sources.  A program of instruction includes fundamental physical and movement training that supports the technique shown in the sources, and it also includes tactical training derived from the techniques and commentaries of the original masters.  The class will consist of lecture, question-and-answer, and demonstration.</p>

            <p><span>Concepts of Modern Chivalry- Randall Parr</span><br/>
            This presentation will discuss why chivalry is experiencing a revival today, and how traditional ideals of knightly behavior are relevantly translated and applied to modern culture.</p>

            <p><span>A Tour through Il Fior di Battaglia's structure - Bob Charrette</span><br/>
            Bob will present  a class that  is a combination of AV presentation and practice, reexamining Fiore’s system of Remedies, Scholars and Counters, showing an even higher level of internal organization and forethought than is generally recognized by students of Armizare.</p>

            <p><span>The Condottierre - Greg Mele</span><br/>
            The condottierre were the mercenary soldier leaders of the professional, military free companies contracted by the Italian city-states and the Papacy from the late Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance. Greg will take you through and introduction to these men and how the system worked.</p>

            <p><span>The Judicial Duel in Italy - Tom Leoni</span><br/>
            Understanding the judicial duel is understanding one of the principal contexts framing the martial arts that we study. In this brief lecture, Tom will present the way in which the judicial duel was viewed during its heyday in Italy (mid 1550s); however, please bear in mind that although the duel went in and out of legality throughout the ages, most of its tenets remained firmly established in the moral code of Italian society—practically all the way into the 20th Century.</p>

            <p><span">An Introduction to the International Jousting League  - Fred Piraux</span><br/>
            This class will cover the details on how to become involved with the IJL; the mission statement, structure and rules; the state of competitive jousting in the world today; how to become an IJL affiliate (as an individual or event); competitions included in the IJL.</p>

            <p><span>How to Get Started in Competitive Jousting  - Fred Piraux</span><br/>
            This class covers the basic of what is needed to start jousting; armour requirements, working with an armourer, safety considerations.</p>

            <p><span>List Field Operation  - Fred Piraux</span><br/>
            This class will cover the details of what is needed to safely construct and run a jousting list field; rules, match rotation and timing, field personnel, how to properly conduct the passes, field safety and procedures.</p>
