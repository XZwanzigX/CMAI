            <p class="section-heading">Is Chivalric Martial Arts International for you?</p>

            <p class="body-text">Do you love European martial arts?  Have you always wanted to attend a training symposium, but the cost or distance was too great?  Have you always wanted to experience the full Western Martial Arts experience including equestrian combat?  Then the Chivalric Martial Arts International (CMAI) symposium is for you.</p>

            <p class="section-heading">What CMAI offers</p>

            <p class="body-text">CMAI will give you the opportunity to train with some of the finest instructors from around the world in several aspects of the chivalric martial arts from the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries.  You will improve your skills with the longsword, poleaxe, spear, dagger, even jousting and mounted combat.  You now have the opportunity to experience the full expanse of knightly training and combat, from world-renowned experts in each discipline.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Even better, riding experience is not a prerequisite to taking many of the equestrian classes as we will offer several beginner tracks as well as those for the accomplished rider.  There will be some access to several trained horses for those who may need them.</p>

            <p class="section-heading">What if I am only a Beginner, or not experienced, in WMA?</p>

            <p class="body-text">Our instructors are designing classes for all level of WMA practitioners.
